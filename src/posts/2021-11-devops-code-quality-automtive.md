Verifa is an independent and privately owned consultancy company with the single aim of providing expert knowledge and services to our valued customers. When it comes to our consulting, we always put the customer's interests first. We are looking for the next person to join us, who shares our values of being open, honest and providing no bulls**t consulting to our customers!

This role will include supporting our automotive customer releasing embedded systems. Part of their release process involves many quality and security related technologies (e.g. static analysis, test automation, OSS license and security) that are closely integrated with the development process and Continuous Integration.
Besides working on this project, we would like you to be part of growing together with us to build a place where everyone is welcome and enjoys working.
We do not expect you to know everything, because nobody does, but we expect you to be able to learn, develop and deliver to the best of your ability.

### You should already have

* Solid experience with Linux
* Experience managing and orchestrating VMs and containers
* Knowledge/Experience of infrastructure or configuration automation tools like Terraform and/or Ansible
* Ability to develop scripts and understand code with at least one major language (preferably C/C++, otherwise Python, Golang, Java, etc.)

### Great if you have

* Experience with at least one cloud provider, preferably Azure
* Understand the need for orchestrators and have experience with at least one (preferably Kubernetes)
* Understanding the value that Continuous Integration should deliver to the release process

### Bonus points if you have

* Practical experience with high-availability environments
* Practical experience with monitoring applications and developing dashboards (e.g. Prometheus and Grafana)
* Practical experience with regulated environments, such as Automotive or Medical

### Technologies

The primary technologies involved in this customer project primarily include (but not limited to):

* **Cloud:** Azure
* **Infrastructure/Config as Code:** Terraform, Ansible
* **Orchestrators:** Kubernetes
* **CI:** Jenkins
* **OSS:** BlackDuck

You will also be involved in side projects and other activities in Verifa where we use a whole range of technologies.

### About Verifa

We are not your typical consultancy house! We provide our customers with niche services around all things continuous, cloud and DevOps. Our projects are aimed at providing not individual consultants but the combined knowledge of Verifa. Teamwork is a crucial part of our customers' success, where we share problems and ideas internally as much as possible. This also fosters a great opportunity to learn and discover technologies that you might not be directly working with. As such, we expect you to work well with our team and be happy to help support colleagues on other projects with the expectation that someone will return the favour to you.

In order to provide expert consultancy services, our consultants need to constantly develop themselves and learn new technologies. To support this, we aim to give our consultants 20% of their working time to learn new technologies, write blog posts, study and take certifications, and/or give talks at conferences.

Most of our projects involve public cloud providers (GCP, AWS, Azure) and our role is often to help our customers introduce more modern approaches to maintaining infrastructure and delivering/deploying applications. The nature of this work varies from project to project.

We do not expect you to give presentations on topics you do not feel comfortable with, and we do not expect you to perform sales work. We do expect you to work independently and interact directly with our customers, and be able to effectively present your work, and any research or planning that you have done.

We believe in open source values and try to support the open source community through our work.

If this kind of role sounds interesting to you, please provide us with your CV. If your profile and experience look suitable, we will have a 15-30 minute introduction. We use this time to give you more information about Verifa and ask questions, and for us to understand your goals to make sure there is a common interest.
