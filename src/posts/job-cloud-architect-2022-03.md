Verifa is an independent and privately owned group with the single aim of providing expert knowledge and services to our valued customers. When it comes to our consulting, we always put the customer's interests first and use open source products as much as possible. We're looking for the next person to join us, who shares our values of being open, honest and providing no bulls**t consulting to our customers!

The role of a Cloud Architect at Verifa is mainly a technical one, providing services and advice to our customers. But there is also an opportunity to develop other skills, such as public writing or speaking, getting involved with pre-sales activities, or steering on-going marketing activities.

### Must Haves

* Solid experience with Linux
* Solid experience with Networking
* Ability to develop scripts and understand code with at least one major language (e.g. Python, Golang, C, Java, etc.)

### Should Haves

* Experience with at least one cloud provider
* Experience with infrastructure or configuration automation through tools like Terraform and Ansible
* Experience with VM and container technologies
* Understand the need for orchestrators and have experience with at least one (e.g. Kubernetes, Nomad or Docker Swarm)
* Understanding of CI processes and its value

### Nice to haves

* Practical experience with high-availability environments
* Practical experience with monitoring applications and developing dashboards (e.g. Prometheus and Grafana)
* Practical experience with regulated environments, such as Finance, Automotive or Medical
* Team Lead, Project Management or other similar experience

### Technologies

The list of technologies depends on the customer project. Hence, what we have tried to do is summarise the common technologies that we come across. It is not expected that you will know all of these, and it should not be expected that you get to work with all of these at any one time.

* **Infrastructure/Config as Code:** Terraform, Ansible
* **Orchestrators:** Kubernetes, Nomad
* **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, FluxCD
* **Cloud Providers:** AWS, Azure, GCP, VMWare

### Description

We're not your typical consultancy house! We provide our customers with niche services around all things continuous, cloud and DevOps. Our projects are aimed at providing not individual consultants but the combined knowledge of Verifa. Teamwork is a crucial part of our customer's success, where we share problems and ideas internally as much as possible. This also fosters a great opportunity to learn and discover technologies that you might not be directly working with. As such, we expect you to work well with our other consultants and be happy to help support colleagues on other projects with the expectation that someone will return the favour to you.
In order to provide expert consultancy services, our consultants need to constantly develop themselves and learn new technologies. To support this, we aim to give our consultants 20% of their working time to learn new technologies, write blog posts, study and take certifications, and/or give talks at conferences.

Most of our projects involve public cloud providers (GCP, AWS, Azure) and our role is often to help our customers introduce more modern approaches to maintaining infrastructure and deploying applications. The nature of this work varies from project to project. Sometimes our role is to migrate on-premise environments into more modern and cloud-native approaches in the cloud. Other projects we just boost ongoing activities and try to bring the collective Verifa knowledge pool into that project.

You are expected to have a strong foundation in Linux, VMs, Containers, Orchestrators and Networking. You should be familiar with DevOps-style practices (such as CI, Infrastructure as Code, Test Automation, Monitoring). We do not expect you to know everything, because nobody does, but we expect you to be able to learn, develop yourself and deliver to the best of your ability.

We don't expect you to give presentations on topics you do not feel comfortable with, and we do not expect you to perform sales work. We do expect you to work independently and interact directly with our customers, and be able to effectively present your work, and any research or planning that you have done.

We believe in open source values and try to support the open source community through our work.

If this kind of role sounds interesting to you, please provide us with your CV. If your profile and experience look suitable, we'll have a 15-30 minute discovery session. We use this time to give you more information about Verifa and ask questions, and for us to understand your goals to make sure there is a common interest.
